[[key-value.template]]
= Template API

In its very basic shape, the `KeyValueTemplate` uses a `MapAdapter` that wraps a `ConcurrentHashMap` and that uses link:{spring-framework-docs}/core/expressions.html[Spring Expression Language] to run queries and sorting.

NOTE: The used `KeyValueAdapter` does the heavy lifting when it comes to storing and retrieving data.
The data structure influences performance and multi-threading behavior.

You can use a different type or pre-initialize the adapter with some values, and you can do so by using various constructors on `MapKeyValueAdapter`, as the following example shows:

====
[source, java]
----
@Configuration
class MyConfiguration {

  @Bean
  public KeyValueOperations mapKeyValueTemplate() {               <1>
    return new KeyValueTemplate(keyValueAdapter());
  }

  @Bean
  public KeyValueAdapter keyValueAdapter() {
    return new MapKeyValueAdapter(ConcurrentHashMap.class);       <2>
  }
}
----
<1> Defines a custom `KeyValueOperations` bean using the default bean name. See documentation and properties of `@EnableMapRepositories` for further customization.
<2> Defines a custom `KeyValueAdapter` bean using a `ConcurrentHashMap` as storage that is used by `KeyValueTemplate`.

[[key-value.keyspaces]]
== Keyspaces

The following example shows a keyspace for a repository of `Person` objects:

====
[source, java]
----
@KeySpace("persons")
class Person {

  @Id String id;
  String firstname;
  String lastname;
}

class User extends Person {
  String username;
}

template.findAllOf(Person.class); <1>
template.findAllOf(User.class);   <2>
----
<1> Returns all entities for the `persons` keyspace.
<2> Returns only elements of type `User` stored in `persons` keyspace.
====

TIP: `@KeySpace` supports xref:keyvalue/value-expressions.adoc[Value Expressions] allowing dynamic keyspace configuration.

[[key-value.keyspaces-custom]]
=== Custom KeySpace Annotation

You can compose your own `KeySpace` annotations for a more domain-centric usage by annotating one of the attributes with `@AliasFor`.

IMPORTANT: The composed annotation must inherit `@Persistent`.

The following example shows a custom `@KeySpace` annotation:

====
[source, java]
----
@KeySpace
@Persistent
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ ElementType.TYPE })
static @interface CacheCentricAnnotation {

  @AliasFor(annotation = KeySpace.class, attribute = "value")
  String cacheRegion() default "";
}

@CacheCentricAnnotation(cacheRegion = "customers")
class Customer {
  //...
}
----
====

[[key-value.template-query]]
== Querying

Running queries is managed by a `QueryEngine`.
As mentioned earlier, you can instruct the `KeyValueAdapter` to use an implementation-specific `QueryEngine` that allows access to native functionality.
When used without further customization, queries can be run by using `SpELQueryEngine`.

NOTE: For performance reasons, we highly recommend to make use of link:{spring-framework-docs}/core/expressions/evaluation.html#expressions-compiler-configuration[compiled SpEL Expressions].
("`SpEL`" is short for "`Spring Expression Language`".) You can use the `-Dspring.expression.compiler.mode=IMMEDIATE` switch to enable it.

The following example shows a query that uses the SpEL:

====
[source,java]
----
KeyValueQuery<String> query = new KeyValueQuery<String>("lastname == 'targaryen'");
List<Person> targaryens = template.find(query, Person.class);
----
====

IMPORTANT: You must have getters and setters present to query properties when you use SpEL.

[[key-value.template-sort]]
== Sorting

Depending on the store implementation provided by the adapter, entities might already be stored in some sorted way but do not necessarily have to be.Again, the underlying `QueryEngine` is capable of performing sort operations.
When used without further customization, sorting is done by using a `SpelPropertyComparator` extracted from the `Sort` clause.The following example shows a query with a `Sort` clause:

====
[source, java]
----
KeyValueQuery<String> query = new KeyValueQuery<String>("lastname == 'baratheon'");
query.setSort(Sort.by(DESC, "age"));
List<Person> targaryens = template.find(query, Person.class);
----
====

IMPORTANT: Please note that you need to have getters and setters present to sort using SpEL.
