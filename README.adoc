# Spring Data Key Value

The primary goal of the http://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies. This module provides infrastructure components to build repository abstractions for stores dealing with Key/Value pairs and ships with a default `java.util.Map` based implementation.

## Features

* Infrastructure for building repositories on top of key/value implementations.
* Dynamic SpEL query generation from query method names.
* Possibility to integrate custom repository code.


## Quick Start

Download the jar through Maven:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-keyvalue</artifactId>
  <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
----

For snapshot versions, make sure you include the spring snapshots repository:

[source, xml]
----
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>spring-libs-snapshot</id>
    <url>http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
----

The `ConcurrentHashMap` based default configuration looks like this:

[source, java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableMapRepositories("com.acme.repositories")
class AppConfig { … }
----

NOTE: it is possible to change the used `java.util.Map` implementation via `@EnableMapRepositories(mapType=….class)`.

Create the domain type and use `@KeySpace` to explicitly group values into one region. By default the types class name is used.

[source, java]
----
@KeySpace("user")
class User {

  @Id String uuid;
  String firstname;
}
----

Create a repository interface in `com.acme.repositories`:

[source, java]
----
public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, String> {
  List<String> findByLastname(String lastname);
}
----

## QueryDSL

To use Querydsl with Spring Data KeyValue repositories, `com.mysema.querydsl:querydsl-collections:3.6.0` (or better) needs to be present on the classpath. Just add `QueryDslPredicateExecutor` to the repository definition and use `com.mysema.query.types.Predicate` to define the query.


## Tips
To have the maximum performance we encourage you to use the latest Spring 4.1.x or better release with compiled SpEL expressions enabled.

[source, bash]
----
-Dspring.expression.compiler.mode=IMMEDIATE
----
